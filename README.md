# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns

In this project, I built my first neural network and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

### The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

1. Create a new conda environment:
```conda create --name deep-learning python=3```

2. Enter your new environment:

```Mac/Linux: >> source activate deep-learning```

```Windows: >> activate deep-learning```

3. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:

```conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook```

4. Run the following to open up the notebook server:

```jupyter notebook```

5. In your browser, open ```Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb```.

6. Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the ```my_answers.py``` python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.
7. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook.
